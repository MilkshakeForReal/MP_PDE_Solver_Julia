# MP_PDE_Julia

Generating data for the wave equation is working fine with high accuracy but low speed. 

Generating data for the combined equation requires fixing bugs from [upstream](MilkshakeForReal/MP_PDE_Solver_Julia).

The whole model is implemented and each block is tested. The forward pass for the pipline needs to be added.
