# MP PDE Solver in Julia

This is a Julia implementation of the [message passing solver](https://github.com/brandstetter-johannes/MP-Neural-PDE-Solvers)

Generating data for the wave equation is working fine with high accuracy but low speed. 

The whole model is implemented and each block is tested. The forward pass for the pipline needs to be added.
